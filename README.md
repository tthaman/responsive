Responsive Web Design (RWD)

This is the final project for the Introduction to Responsive Web Design course offerred by [Mario Hernandez]
(http://about.me/mario.hernandez).

This project demonstrate the many elements of RWD such as multi-column layout, flexible navigation, 
source ordering, resizable images and more.  In addition, the use of a grid system allows us to provide
order and structure to our website.
